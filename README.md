# Admin-dashboard

The making of the Admin Dashboard has been a long haul but filled with enthusiasm to make it look good. It is dashboard project of random company showing the page with header, side-navigation bar and different cards.

This helped me learn many CSS properties extensively. Though it's not responsive to greater extent, I plan to keep working on it.
